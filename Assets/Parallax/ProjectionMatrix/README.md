# AsymFrustum
Asymmetric Frustum
An example Unity3d implementation of an asymmetric frustum. Complete with a virtual screen/window and side-by-side rendering

based on http://paulbourke.net/stereographics/stereorender/ and http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/165443/asymmetric-view-frusta-selective-region-rendering.html

I see wrong implementations of that all the time. This works well - for example for the Amazon Fire Phone or in case you want to create applications with webcam based head tracking.
